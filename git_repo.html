  				<dt><a href="#"><span>+</span> Initializing a Repo from an Existing Directory</a></dt>
  				<dd style="">
            <p class="tuts">
              If you're starting from an existing project in Git, you need to go to that project's directory in the terminal.
              Go ahead and navigate into that directory with 'cd /name of directory'. Then type the following:
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git init
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              This creates a subdirectory named '.git' that contains all the needed files for a Git repo. So far you've installed Git, and
              now you have to begin tracking your project. Go ahead and type the following: 
            </p>  
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git add .<br>
                $ git commit -m 'your first commit is typed here, this is sample copy'
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              Now it's time to track changes to your project. As you edit your files,
              Git sees them as modified since your last commit. Go ahead and make a change to a file, or add a file in
              the project, and type this:
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git status<br>
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              At this point, you should see that Git has noticed a change in your directory. Untracked changes will remain that way
              until you commit them. When you 'git commit' them, you are staging changes, then tracking them. These two states are the key
              concepts that manage your style of development. A common life cycle that repeats itself often.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              The best practice is to 'git commit' all changes with a clear description, annotating them for future observation. So when 
              you or others revisit a change you've committed, you understand exactly what you've done.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts"> 
              If you haven't made any changes, you'll see the following:
            </p>              
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git status<br>
                nothing to commit (working directory clean)
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts"> 
              This means nothing has changed and there are no new files in your working directory. Now go ahead and add a change or 
              file to your directory and type 'git status'.
            </p>              
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git status<br>
                # On branch master
                # Changes not staged for commit:
                (use "git add <file>..." to updated what will be committed)
                (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
                modified:  /name_of_file_changed.erb
                no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts"> 
              You should see the name of the file you've added. Go ahead and stage the file: git commit -m or git add  . then
              add your description of the change in quotes: "I added a file to test git."
              Congratulations, you're now tracking files. For more info: go to

  				<dd style="">
            <p class="tuts">
              When you create a project on Github, you will need to clone this repo to your local repository.
              See the next Cheatsheet: <span class="strong em"><a href="/clone_a_repository_path">How to Clone a Git Repository</a></span>
              for info on how do this, after you've gone through the following steps.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em"><a href="https://github.com">Github</a></span> is a place to put your project, you'll need a Github account
              to do this. Once you have an account set up, you'll then create a repository for each project.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              Anyhow, first create a new repository in your Github account. It's the first graphic just right of your name
              in the top upper-right of your browser window.

              Simply check a radio button to activate the settings. Making projects Public means everyone

              project - useful when you're working with clients.
