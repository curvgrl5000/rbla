            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Many of us are used to using GUIS</span> (Graphical User Interfaces), but learning how to use the 
              CLI ( Command Line Interface ), is essential for programming.  Common names include the Shell, CLI,
               Terminal and Console. But exactly what is the Command Line? At it’s core, it’s simply the place 
               where you type commands.<br> 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"><b>Wikipedia</b></a> defines the Terminal this way:
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              “A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interaction with a computer program where the user 
              (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). 
              A command-line interface is one type of text-based user interface.”
            </p>  
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">On a Mac,</span> launch the Terminal from the utilities folder inside of your main Applications folder.
              Apple Mac OS X[4] and many Linux distributions have the Bash implementation of the Unix shell.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">On MS Windows</span> users use the Command Prompt or the PowerShell. Android uses a Unix shell derived 
              from Ash with commands from the separate toolbox.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">We will be concerning ourselves with the Mac side of things.</p>

  				<dt><a href="#"><span>+</span> The syntax of the Command Line</a></dt>
  				<dd style="">
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Most commands have three parts</span> and start with the '$' symbol.
              The Utility or Command Name, The Flags or Options and The Argument(s). <br>
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">$ ls -1 ~/Desktop</h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">Okay, let's break each part down:</p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">$</span> is the common symbol for <span class="strong">SELECT</span>, which indicates that you’re ready to type 
              commands into the command line. You don’t have to type this, it’s inherited with the prompt.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">ls</span> is the <span class="strong">UTILITY</span>. Generally known as 'commands' as they 
              are indicating what you want the computer to do. In this case 'ls' is the command to list the contents 
              of directories.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">-1</span> is the <span class="strong">FLAG</span> or <span class="strong">OPTION</span>. This changes or alters how a utility may 
              operate slightly. Usually the default works just fine, but flags allow you to modify them to your liking. 
              They start with one or two dashes. In this case, the option '-1' means one file per line.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">~/Desktop</span> is the <span class="strong">ARGUMENT</span> to the utility. Arguments are used to define 
              exactly what the utility might need to know for certain actions, and there is no 
              clear default setting. Here, the Argument tells the utility which directory to list.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              To get a list of all commands, type the following:<br>
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">$ man command</h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">FYI: <span class="strong em">Man</span> means <span class="strong">manual</span>.</p>

            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Remember guys,</span> you're ready to go when you see the '$' in the terminal. You're now
              ready to code. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">cd</span> 'Change Directory' allows you to go to another directory. Remember you have to
              define this utility with a path, for instance: cd ~/my_machine/new_path.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">cd ..</span> 'Change Directory ..' when you want to go up a directory vs. down a directory.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">exit</span> 'Exit' literally exits a terminal window.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">irb</span> 'Interactive Ruby', which you have to have <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">installed</a>. Now watch for the prompt! 
              When launching irb, the prompt will change from '$' to '>'. That means you have to exit irb with the buttons 'control d', to 
              get back to the former context.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Ctrl-D</span> 'Control D' tells the terminal to register an EOF: 'End of File' on standard input, which the terminal 
              interprets as a desire to exit.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">ls</span> 'Lists' what is in the current directory.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">man -k "topic"</span>'Manual Lookup Topic', looks up and displays what you're 
              looking for in quotes.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">mkdir</span> 'Make Directory', allows you to make a folder.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">pwd</span> 'Print Working Directory', gives you the full path of where you are.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">rails new app_name</span> 'Rails New Application Name', will create the entire directory structure of a new rails application. 
              'rails' is the Gem, 'new' the command to create a new rails app, and 'app_name' is just the placeholder for the name you'll be giving your app.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">rails s</span> Shorthand for 'Rails Server launches a local server, you then open
              a browser window and type: localhost:3000 will render a local version of your work in the browser.
