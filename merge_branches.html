            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Git stores data as snapshots</span> and commits are essentially pointers
              to each progressive commit. A Git 'branch' is nearly synonymous to a 'head', which means that every branch
              represents one 'head' and can represent an entire ancestoral history of commits preceding that 'head'.
              A branch can be considered the context you're working in. Switching branches means you're switching contexts.  
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              You can also think of a 'head' as the 'current branch'. And when you switch branches with 'git checkout',
              the 'head' now points to the tip of the new branch. Each commit stores the latest change to a branch,
              which allows you to go back and forth in a project, within the context of a branch, within the same directory. 
             </p>
             <p class="tuts">  
              Say for instance you're working with a group of other programmers. Each of your team members has 
              been assigned a specific task. To be able to work on the same 'repo', everyone needs to create a new branch. This allows for 
              everyone to work on the project locally or independently, making changes and testing thier code before merging back to 
              the 'master branch'. 
             </p>
             <p class="tuts">  
              When merge conflicts arise, a 'repo' can be rolled back to a previous commit and the conflict can be
              explored on an individual branch. That's essentially how branches can be used. There are other uses, but this being
              the fundamental and most common use. 
             </p>
             <p class="tuts">
              You can always find out which branch you're on, by typing 'git branch', which lists the available branches.
              The starred branch is the one you're currently on. 
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git branch<br>
                $ * master<br>
              </h6>

  				<dd style="">
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">You can create a new branch</span> by running 'git branch name_of_branch'.
              Then run 'git branch' to see which branch we are still on.
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git branch test<br>
                $ git branch<br>
                * master
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              Okay, so we are still on the 'master' branch. Now let's switch to the new branch, 'test'.
              That's easy, simply run 'git checkout test'.
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git checkout test<br>
                $ git branch<br>
                $ master<br>
                $ * test
              </h6>
             </div>
             <p class="tuts">
               Now we've switched to the 'test' branch. Go ahead add a file to the test branch, by running
               'git add README testing.rb', then commit your change and switch back to the master branch and 
               list the contents. 
             </p>
             <div class="coding">
               <h6 class="steps">
                 $ git add . README testing.rb <br>
                 $ git commit -m "added a file"<br>
                 $ git checkout master<br>
                 $ ls
               </h6>
              </div>
              <p class="tuts">
                This last commmand, 'ls' will list what is in the current directory of the 'master'; however anything
                added to the previous branch that has not bee merged to 'master' are not longer there. Rember, you're 
                now in the Master brahcn, or current contest.

  				<dd style="">
            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Git Pull</span> will pull down from a remote and instantly merge into the branch you're
              in when you make the request. Pull is a high-level request, that runs 'fetch' and
              'merge' by default.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              Similar to git fetch, you can use git <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> to fetch a specific
              branch and merge it into your current local branch. For one-time pull from other 
              user's repos, you can use a URL in place of a remote name.
