              <span class="strong em">Git stores data as snapshots</span> and commits are essentially pointers
              to each progressive commit. You can think of a branch as the context you're working in. And switching branches 
              means you're switching contexts. 
            </p>  
            <p class="tuts">  
              A Git 'branch' is nearly synonymous to a 'head', which means that every branch represents one 'head' and can 
              represent an entire ancestoral history of commits preceding that 'head' in an isolated development environment.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              You can also think of a 'head' as the 'current branch'. And when you switch branches with 'git checkout',
              the 'head' now points to the tip of the new branch. Each commit stores the latest change to a branch,
              which allows you to go back and forth in a project, within the context of a branch.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">  
              Say for instance you're working with a group of programmers. Each of your team mates has been assigned a new feature. 
              To work with the same 'repo', you create a dedicated branch and then switch into it, allowing you to work independently
              before merging your work to the 'master' branch.  
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              You can always find out which branch you're on, by typing 'git branch', which lists the available branches.
              The starred branch is the one you're currently on. 
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git branch<br>
                $ master<br>
                $ * new_feature

            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">You can create a new branch</span> by running 'git branch test'.
              Now go ahead and run 'git branch' which will note the active branch with an asterick.
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git branch test<br>
                $ git branch<br>
                * master
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              We've created a new branch 'test', but we are still on the 'master' branch. Let's switch to the new branch, 'test'.
              That's easy, simply run 'git checkout test'. And then run 'git branch' to see which branch we're on.
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git checkout test<br>
                $ git branch<br>
                $ master<br>
                $ * test
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              Next create a file called testing.rb in your project, then stage it by running 'git add testing.rb', and commit your 
              change. Now switch back to the master branch, with 'git checkout master'. 
              Finally list the contents of this branch by running 'ls'.
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git add testing.rb  <br>
                $ git commit -m "added a file testing.rb"<br>
                $ git checkout master<br>
                $ ls
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              This last commmand, 'ls' will list what is in the current directory of the 'master' branch; however anything
              added to the test branch will not be listed. 
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">  
              Remember, you're now in the 'master' branch and you haven't merged
              branches yet. When you're ready to merge 'test' you can do so by running 'git merge test'. 
            </p>

            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">To Merge</span> a branch you first need to start in the 'master'
              branch, then run the 'git merge' command. This will join two development histories together
              into a single branch. 
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">  
              Then when the two branches have merged, it's a common workflow to delete
              the working branch, in this case you would be deleting the 'test' branch.
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git checkout master<br>
                $ git merge test<br>
                $ git branch -d test
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              When there is a conflict, git will prevent the branches from merging. You can then run 'git status'
              which will show you the files that need to be resolved. 
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">  
              Typically small features are used for 
              'fast-foward' merges and larger ones are called 3-way merges that include larger feature branches.

              job of describing the basics of branching and merging.
