              <span class="strong em">Typing 'git clone' in the command line</span> will copy a repo into a newly created directory,

              This command additionally creates a remote called 'origin' for the repo cloned from, 
              and sets up a local branch based on the remote's active branch (usually master). It also
              creates remote-tracking branches for all the branches in the repository.

              <span class="strong em">A current local repo</span> with a remote set up for the current project, 
              you can git fetch<REMOTENAME>. Git fetch is similar to pull, but it will not do any merging.

            <p class="tuts">
              Fetch does not make any changes to local branches, so you will need
              to merge a remote branch with a paired local branch to incorporate newly 'fetched' changes.

              <span class="strong em">Git Pull</span> will pull down from a remote and instantly merge into the branch you're
              in when you make the request. Pull is a high-level request, that runs 'fetch' and
              'merge' by default.
            </p>
            <p class="tuts">
              Similar to git fetch, you can use git <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> to fetch a specific
              branch and merge it into your current local branch. For one-time pull from other 
              user's repos, you can use a URL in place of a remote name.

            <p class="tuts">
              <span class="strong em">Git Push</span> is the command that pushes your local repository to a
              remote repository. It's the opposite of 'git fetch', where fetching imports commits to your local
              branch, pushing exports commits to remote branches. Here we're creating a destination branch, which 
              prevents you from overwriting commits when it results in a non-fast-forwward merge. 
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git push remote_name branch_name><br>
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              A 'remote' repo with a destination of a push operation can be an URL or the name of a remote.
              Typically URls contain info about the transport process and the address of the remote server,
              and the path to the repo. You can think of 'git push' essentially the same command as 'git merge master'
              from nside the remote repo. For example: 
            </p>
            <div class="coding">
              <h6 class="steps">
                $ git checkout master<br>
                $ git fetch origin master<br>
                $ git checkout master<br>
              </h6>
            </div>
            <p class="tuts">
              To stay in sync with a remote repo, git prevents you from overwriting the remote 'origin master' wiht a non-fast foward merge.
              Basically it means git is forcing you to first download the origin master, then work loacally and then merge locally before
              pushing back to the remote branch. We'll be pushing to both Github and Heroku in the next cheatsheet
